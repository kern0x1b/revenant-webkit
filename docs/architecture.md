# How the engine gets underneath Safari

The phone's own Mobile Safari renders the modern web because the engine below it
is replaced at launch. Nothing of Safari's interface is reimplemented: every
gesture, scroll, text selection and keyboard behaviour is UIKit's, unchanged.

The proof it took is the user agent. iOS 6 reports `AppleWebKit/536`; with the
port loaded the same browser reports:

    Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_7 like Mac OS X)
    AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/15E148

## Why substitute rather than write a browser

A hand-written browser has to reimplement everything UIKit's `UIWebBrowserView`
already does, and then keep reimplementing it as new cases appear. Substituting
the engine underneath UIKit inherits all of that at once, and it is Apple's code
that keeps working.

## The three artifacts

The system engine lives in the dyld shared cache, not on disk, so there is no
file to replace — and replacing it system-wide would put a 2026 engine under
every process on the phone. Instead a loader is injected into the launching app,
points `DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH` / `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` at the port's build, and
re-execs. The second launch loads the new engine first.

| Artifact | On device | Built by | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Loader | `/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/RevSafari.dylib` | `packaging/loader` | Reads the enabled-apps preference, re-execs an enabled app with the engine's `DYLD_*` set, skips SpringBoard |
| Engine | `/usr/lib/rev-fw/{JavaScriptCore,WebCore,WebKit}.framework` | CMake + `scripts/layout-sys-frameworks.sh` | The WebKit build itself |
| Compat | `/usr/lib/rev-safari-compat.dylib` | `packaging/compat` | The ABI iOS 6 predates, the bookmarks start page, WebAssembly, preference reads |

### Framework names have to be the system's

UIKit asks for the frameworks by their system install names, so the build is laid
out under those names rather than its own:

| built as | installed as | install name |
|---|---|---|
| `WebKitLegacy.framework/WebKitLegacy` | `WebKit.framework/WebKit` | `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/WebKit.framework/WebKit` |
| `WebCore.framework/WebCore` | same | `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/WebCore.framework/WebCore` |
| `JavaScriptCore.framework/JavaScriptCore` | same | unchanged, already matches |

Cross-references between the three must use those same system paths, not
`@executable_path`, so that the substitution catches them too.

### Why the environment is set by the process itself

iOS 6's dyld ignores `LC_DYLD_ENVIRONMENT`, so the variables cannot be baked into
the executable, and SpringBoard passes no environment through. The loader sets
them and re-executes:

```c
if (!getenv("DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH")) {
    setenv("DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH", "/usr/lib/rev-fw", 1);
    execv(self, argv);
}
```

`execv` keeps the pid, so SpringBoard's launch handshake survives.

### Why the namespace is flat

iOS 6 exported the Objective-C DOM (`DOMElement` and 16 siblings) from WebCore;
2.54 moved those classes to WebKitLegacy. UIKit's undefined symbols record which
library is expected to supply each one, so under the normal two-level namespace
dyld looks for `DOMElement` in our WebCore and does not find it.
`DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE=1` drops the library ordinal and lets any loaded image
satisfy the symbol.

## Two WebKits in one process

Before the substitution existed, the port ran as an ordinary app that also linked
UIKit — and UIKit pulls in the system WebKit for `UIWebView`. dyld loads
dependencies before the app's own frameworks, so iOS 6's classes registered first
and the port's lost:

```
objc[9248]: Class WebPreferences is implemented in both
  /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/WebKit.framework/WebKit and
  .../Frameworks/WebKitLegacy.framework/WebKitLegacy.
  One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.
```

221 classes collided: 88 `Web*` against the system `WebKit.framework`, and 133
more — the whole `DOM*` binding surface plus `WAK*`, `WebEvent`,
`WebScriptObject`, `WebLayer`, `WebAccessibilityObjectWrapper` — against the
system `WebCore.framework`. Every `[WebView …]` call then landed in a 2012
implementation while 2026 C++ expected a 2026 object layout, and the process died
with SIGBUS inside `WebKitInitialize()`.

The answer was a prefix: `compat/stubs/ios6_class_prefix.h` renames the colliding
classes, force-included into every compile. Four places look a class up by name
rather than by identifier, where a macro cannot reach inside a string literal, and
use `IOS6_CLASS_NAME(x)` instead:

- `WebCore/bridge/objc/objc_runtime.mm` — `WebScriptObject`, `WebUndefined`
- `WebCore/accessibility/ios/WebAccessibilityObjectWrapperIOS.mm` — `WebView`
- `WebCore/testing/Internals.mm` — `WebCoreBundleFinder`

Under substitution the system engine is never loaded, so there is nothing to
collide with and UIKit needs the classes under their real names — it links
`_OBJC_CLASS_$_WebView`, not the prefixed spelling. That is why the shipped build
is configured without the prefix; the prefix header remains for any build that has
to share a process with the system engine.

## What UIKit actually needs from an engine

Measured from the shared cache rather than guessed: across the 18 system libraries
that import from WebKit, WebCore and JavaScriptCore, 147 symbols are imported in
total, and UIKit itself uses 80. `tools/dsc-imports.py` and `tools/objc-surface.py`
do the counting.

One thing is not a symbol: UIKit gets its `WKWindowRef` by sending
`-[WAKWindow _windowRef]`, an accessor 2.54 dropped along with the C window layer.
Restoring it was the last step before the first successful load.
