# A modern web engine for iOS 6

The stock engine on iOS 6 is WebKit 536 (2012). It cannot render a page written
this decade: the sign-in form of soundcloud.com comes back with zero input
elements in the DOM, because the script that builds it never runs.

The goal is a browser view — one `UIView`, one URL, no chrome — running an
engine new enough to open today's sites on an iPhone 4S. If that works, the same
view becomes a way to package web apps for these devices.

## Base: current WebKit trunk

The build tracks `WebKit/WebKit` `main`. An earlier attempt used the Safari-603
branch (iOS 10.3, 2017) on the assumption that it was the last WebKit ever built
for 32-bit ARM. That assumption was wrong in a useful way:

- armv7 is still a live target in trunk. What was removed — on 2026-08-01, three
  weeks before this was written — is the ARMv7 **JIT**. The commit says so
  plainly: *"ARMv7 runs on CLoop now."* `Source/JavaScriptCore/assembler/` keeps
  only ARM64, ARM64E, RISCV64 and X86_64, and `ENABLE_JIT` auto-enables on
  X86_64 and ARM64 only. So JavaScript is interpreted on this device.
- Apple's clang 21 still emits armv7 Mach-O and still accepts a 6.0 deployment
  target, so C++23 code compiles for a 2011 phone.
- Trunk's build scripts are Python 3. The 603 branch's are Python 2, and every
  failure in that attempt was a dead stdlib module or a changed built-in, never
  WebKit's own C++.

The 603 checkout stays in the tree as a fallback and as a source of code trunk
has since deleted — the Darwin ARM32 register accessors came from there.

## Prior art on the same device: LightKit

`org.webkit.LightweightBrowser`, armv7, `MinimumOSVersion` 4.3, found already
installed on the target iPhone 4S. No source published. Its binaries answer most
of the open design questions:

- **It is the Cocoa WebKitLegacy port, not WPE.** `WebKitLegacy` links CFNetwork,
  and its Objective-C classes are `LegacyIOSWebView`, `LegacyIOSWAKWindow`,
  `LegacyIOSWebEvent`, `LegacyIOSWAKScrollView` — the ordinary iOS WebKitLegacy
  classes with a prefix applied so they cannot collide with the system WebKit.
  That is the same API `UIWebView` is built on.
- **The engine is recent.** `WebCore` contains `view-transition`, `anchor-name`,
  `@scope`, `:has()`, `subgrid`, `popover`, `corner-shape`, `sibling-index`, CSS
  `@function`, `progress()` and `text-box-trim` — 2025-era features.
- **`libLegacyIOSRuntime.dylib` (31 MB) is a C++ runtime, not an API shim.**
  10 414 exports, 9 048 of them mangled C++: modern libc++ (`std::__1`),
  libc++abi and ICU 74, depending on nothing but `libSystem` and `libobjc`.
  iOS 6 ships a 2012 libc++ and an ICU far older than WebKit's minimum, so a
  current WebKit has to carry its own.
- **`LegacyIOSModernTLSURLProtocol`** — an `NSURLProtocol` subclass implementing
  modern TLS, because CFNetwork on iOS 6 cannot negotiate with today's servers.

Its full system dependency list, all present in iOS 6: UIKit, CoreGraphics,
QuartzCore, CoreFoundation, Foundation, CFNetwork, AVFoundation, CoreMedia,
CoreAudio, AudioToolbox, Accelerate, IOKit, `libxml2`, `libsqlite3`, `libz`,
`libAccessibility`, `libgcc_s.1`.

## State

Built for armv7 against the iPhoneOS 10.3 SDK with a 6.0 deployment target:

| Part | Status |
|---|---|
| `libbmalloc.a` | builds |
| `libWTF.a` | builds — 174 files, no C++ errors |
| `libJavaScriptCore.a` | builds — 23 MB, CLoop interpreter |
| ICU 74.2 (`libicuuc`, `libicui18n`, `libicudata`) | builds, `--disable-renaming` |
| libc++ 21 / libc++abi for armv7 | builds |
| `jsc` shell | **runs on the iPhone 4S** |
| WebCore, WebKitLegacy | building |

### Milestone 1 result

`jsc` from trunk runs on the device, and it is a current engine, not a subset:

```
private field: 5                                  // #x
optional chain: ok                                // ?. and ??
Object.groupBy: {"odd":[1,3],"even":[2,4]}        // ES2024
Array.fromAsync: function                          // ES2024
RegExp v flag: true                                // ES2024
Temporal: object                                   // ES2026
```

First throughput numbers. The comparison mixes two effects — a 2011 CPU and the
absence of a JIT — so treat it as an order of magnitude, not a JIT penalty:

| | iPhone 4S, CLoop | Mac, JIT |
|---|---|---|
| `fib(24)` | 97 ms | 3 ms |
| 2 M iteration loop | 2128 ms | 7 ms |

Roughly a million simple JS operations per second.

### The JIT question

The ARMv7 JIT was not removed because it broke. Between 2026-03-08 and
2026-03-15 WebKit started forcing it off for every 32-bit build:

```
#if USE(JSVALUE32_64)
#undef ENABLE_JIT
#define ENABLE_JIT 0
```

The now-orphaned assembler was deleted on 2026-08-01 (`857bd4334690`,
*"ARMv7 runs on CLoop now"*). So a checkout from before mid-March 2026 still has
a working ARMv7 JIT — five months of engine work traded for a large constant
factor on JavaScript. Worth measuring once there is a page to measure.

The second condition is executable memory. The device is jailbroken and does not
enforce code signing, so `mmap` with `PROT_EXEC` should work — but that has to be
tested, not assumed.

## Build environment

C++23 needs a libc++ newer than anything in the iOS 10.3 SDK, so headers come
from the current Xcode SDK while the C library and frameworks come from the old
one:

```
-target armv7-apple-ios6.0
-isysroot .../iPhoneOS10.3.sdk
-nostdinc++ -isystem .../iPhoneOS26.5.sdk/usr/include/c++/v1
-D_LIBCPP_DISABLE_AVAILABILITY
```

Headers are enough to compile. The **runtime** is a separate problem, and the
one LightKit solved by bundling its own — see milestone 2.

Two settings are not obvious:

- **`-fdwarf-exceptions`.** clang defaults armv7 to setjmp/longjmp exceptions and
  emits references to `__gxx_personality_sj0`. iOS ships only the DWARF
  personality, `__gxx_personality_v0`.
- **ICU `--disable-renaming`.** WebKit defines `U_DISABLE_RENAMING=1` on Apple
  platforms because Apple's `libicucore` exports unsuffixed names. A stock ICU
  build exports `u_charDirection_74`, so it must be built the same way.

`build-icu.sh` builds ICU twice: once for this Mac, because ICU needs its own
tools to generate its data, and once for the device. `build-libcxx.sh` builds
libc++ and libc++abi from `llvmorg-21.1.0`, matching the header version.

## Patches to WebKit

`patches/ios6-armv7.patch` — six files, thirty added lines:

- `Source/bmalloc/bmalloc/bmalloc.h` — `aligned_alloc` is C11 and arrived in
  iOS 11; `posix_memalign` has the same contract for these callers
- `Source/JavaScriptCore/runtime/MachineContext.h` — restore the Darwin ARM32
  register accessors (`__r[7]` as frame pointer), deleted along with the JIT
- `Source/WTF/wtf/PlatformHave.h` — no readline in the iOS SDK
- `Source/WTF/wtf/PlatformJSCOnly.cmake` — run `mig` against the macOS SDK; the
  iOS SDK ships no `mach/*.defs`
- `Source/WTF/wtf/darwin/OSLogPrintStream.mm` — `os_log` is iOS 10; write to
  stderr
- `Source/cmake/WebKitMacros.cmake` — create the destination directory before
  symlinking forwarding headers

## Milestones

1. **JavaScriptCore builds for armv7 and runs a script on the device.** The
   smallest thing that proves the toolchain. The libraries build; the shell is
   blocked on milestone 2.
2. **A C++ runtime that works on iOS 6.** libc++ and libc++abi built for armv7
   and linked in, as LightKit does.
3. **WebCore and WebKitLegacy build**, with the `LegacyIOS` symbol prefix so they
   coexist with the system WebKit.
4. **An app with a single view showing one URL.**
5. **Modern TLS**, as an `NSURLProtocol`.
6. **Measurements**: memory, first paint, scrolling. 512 MB of RAM and an
   interpreter-only JavaScript engine are the two numbers that decide whether
   this is usable or merely impressive.
