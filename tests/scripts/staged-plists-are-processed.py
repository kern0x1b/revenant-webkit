"""Refuse a staged framework whose Info.plist is the unprocessed one, or absent.

    tests/scripts/staged-plists-are-processed.py

CMake writes its own Info.plist for a framework target every time it regenerates,
and the engine post-build command replaces it with the processed one. A build
that reconfigures and relinks nothing loses that race and stages the default:
no MinimumOSVersion, no UIDeviceFamily, an empty CFBundleName. It loads, it runs,
and nothing says the bundle lost what identifies it - which is why this refuses
rather than warns.

Which bundles must carry one comes from charon.toml: a framework staged with its
resources is opened as a bundle, so a missing plist is the same loss arriving
quietly. Walking the plists that happen to be there cannot see that.
